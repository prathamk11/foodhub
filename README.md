# **FoodHub Project**

## **Overview**
The **FoodHub** project is an online food ordering and delivery system where users can browse food items, add them to a cart, and place an order. The system includes an admin panel for managing food items, users, and orders.

## **Project Structure**
### **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**
The frontend is responsible for displaying the website, taking user inputs, and handling user interactions.

#### **Key Features:**
- Homepage with food categories and featured items.
- Menu page displaying all available food items.
- Cart functionality for adding/removing items.
- User registration & login.
- Order placement system.
- Responsive UI (CSS for styling).

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** Structure of the website.
- **CSS:** Styling (including Bootstrap for responsiveness).
- **JavaScript:** Interactive features (cart system, form validation, AJAX for requests).

---

### **Backend (SQL & PHP/Python/Node.js)**
The backend handles user authentication, database operations, and order processing.

#### **Key Features:**
- User authentication (Login/Register).
- Managing food items (Admin can add, edit, delete).
- Order management (View, update, delete orders).
- Payment processing (if implemented).

#### **Database (SQL):**
A relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) is used to store:
- **Users:** Stores user details like name, email, password, and address.
- **Food Items:** Contains food details like name, description, price, and image.
- **Orders:** Stores order information including user ID, order details, total price, and status.
- **Cart Items:** Stores items added to the cart by users.

## **How the System Works**
1. **User Registration/Login:** Users can sign up and log in using their credentials. Their data is stored in the Users table.
2. **Browsing Food Menu:** Users can view food items from the Food Items table.
3. **Adding Items to Cart:** Users can add/remove items to/from their cart. The cart items are stored temporarily in local storage or the Cart Items table.
4. **Placing an Order:** When the user places an order, the data is stored in the Orders table.
5. **Admin Panel:** The admin can log in to add/edit/delete food items and manage orders.
